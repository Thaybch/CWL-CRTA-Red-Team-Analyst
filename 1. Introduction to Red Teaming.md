### 1.1  What is Red Teaming ?
 A Red Team is a group of hackers with varying backgrounds that test the organization’s infrastructure.
 
 Attacks performed by Red Teams are divided into 3 groups: 
 
   - Cyber (Digital Attacks includes Web, Network & other Cloud technologies)
   - Social Attacks (Exploiting people’s behaviour)
   - Physical (Attacks involving physical man-power)
    
A Red Team operations is similar to a penetration test but is more targeted

### 1.2  Red Team Attack Lifecycle (Phases) 

High-level overview of Red Team Attack lifecycle is shown below:

#### Extensive OSINT
This phase focuses on gathering extensive information about the target, especially from social media and platforms where employees are active, to identify sensitive data that can be used for further exploitation.


#### Initial Access & Execution
Initial Access involves exploiting weaknesses like misconfigured services or web apps to enter the internal network. The approach depends on the organization's tech stack. Once inside, attackers execute their code to perform actions like network discovery.

#### Persistence & Privilege Escalation
Attackers aim to maintain persistent access even after system reboots or credential changes, often by exploiting overlooked accounts or backdoors. They also seek to escalate privileges by exploiting system flaws or misconfigurations to gain elevated access such as root, administrator, or membership in privileged groups.

#### Lateral Movement
Lateral movement occurs when attackers, after compromising one system, navigate through the network to access others. They may use remote access tools or valid credentials with built-in system utilities to stay stealthy. Common methods include internal phishing and exploiting remote services like SSH, RDP, or VNC.

#### Defensive Evasion
Defensive evasion involves techniques attackers use to avoid detection, such as obfuscating code, hiding in legitimate processes, or disabling security tools. It relies on knowledge of the environment and aims to bypass or impair defenses like firewalls and antivirus systems.

#### Discovery 
Situational awareness involves attackers analyzing the target environment to understand its structure and identify critical assets. Techniques like file and directory discovery help them gather insights about the network and plan their next steps effectively.

#### Data Collection
Data collection involves gathering sensitive information from compromised systems or networks. Attackers may target various data types and often compress or encrypt it before exfiltration. Common methods include collecting clipboard data or archiving files for stealthy transfer.

#### Data Exfiltration
Exfiltration is the phase where attackers steal the collected data from the system or network, often compressing or encrypting it to avoid detection. This can be done automatically over the network or physically using devices like USB drives.

### 1.3  Red Team Infrastructure (Nomenclature)

C2 Server (Command and Control): Used to maintain communication with compromised systems.

Payload Server: Hosts malicious scripts/executables, accessible by attacker and victim.

Redirector Server: Acts as a proxy between victim and attacker, hiding the real C2 server and making the setup more resilient.

DMZ (Demilitarized Zone): Public-facing network segment; hosts services like web or mail servers.

MZ (Militarized Zone): Highly secure zone containing critical internal operations and assets.

Adversary Emulation: Imitates real threat groups (e.g., FIN10) using known TTPs.

Adversary Simulation: Simulates a realistic attack without referencing a specific actor.

APT (Advanced Persistent Threat): Stealthy, state-sponsored threat actor with long-term goals.

Exploit: Code used to abuse a vulnerability.

Vulnerability: Weakness in a system that can be exploited.

Tactics: High-level goals (e.g., persistence, lateral movement).

Techniques: General methods (e.g., password dumping).

Procedures: Detailed steps or tools used by threat actors.

Listener: Waits for incoming connections from exploited systems (e.g., via Netcat).

Exploitation: Takes advantage of a vulnerability to run malicious payloads.

Staging Process:

Singles: One-off payloads (e.g., add user).

Stagers: Small initial code to load larger payloads.

Stages: Full-featured payloads (e.g., Meterpreter).

Shells: Text-based system control (e.g., Bash, CMD).

Reverse Shell: Victim connects back to attacker (requires attacker listener).

Bind Shell: Attacker connects to a port opened by the victim.
