### 3.1 External Infrastructure Overview

- Attacker IP: `192.168.50.2`
- Target Web Server IP: `192.168.50.3`
- We will attempt to gain an initial foothold on the Web Server using Web and Network-related vulnerabilities.

### Cyber Kill Chain

1. Reconnaissance  
2. Scanning and Enumeration  
3. Gaining Access  
4. Post Exploitation  
5. Maintaining Persistence  
6. Removing Footprints

### 3.2 Externally Exposed Service Exploitation

- Involves exploiting accessible services on the web or network.
- Adversaries actively connect with exposed servers to identify and exploit loopholes.
- Requires knowledge of target infrastructure and technologies.

---

#### 3.2.1 Information Gathering

- Military term used for acquiring intelligence about the enemy.
- In cyber context, it refers to collecting information on the target machine using tools.

##### Types of Reconnaissance

**Passive Reconnaissance**
- No direct connection with the target.
- Uses publicly available data.
- Undetectable but limited in scope.

**Active Reconnaissance**
- Establishes connection with the target.
- Higher chance of detection.
- More extensive information gathering.

---

#### 3.2.2 Scanning & Enumeration

**Techniques:**
- Host Discovery  
- TCP Port Scanning  
  - Full Scan  
  - SYN (Stealth) Scan  
  - ACK Scan  
  - FIN/NULL/XMAS Scan  
- UDP Port Scanning  
- Service Version Detection  
- OS Detection  

**Tools:**
- `NetDiscover`  
netdiscover -i <interface> -r <IP address CIDR format>
netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24

- `Nmap`  
- Host discovery: `nmap -sn <target>`
   - Host discovery: `nmap -sn 192.168.50.1/24`
- Service detection: `nmap -sV <target>`

#### 3.2.3 Vulnerability Assessment

- Systematic review of security weaknesses.
- 4-step process:
1. Vulnerability Identification  
2. Analysis  
3. Risk Assessment  
4. Remediation  

**Tools:**
- Nessus  
- Acunetix  
- Qualys  
- Netsparker  
- Metasploit  
- Amazon Inspector (for AWS)  
- Nikto (Web apps)  
- Nmap (Network & Web)

#### 3.2.4 Exploitation

##### A. Web-Based Exploitation

- Targets misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in web services.
- Web servers typically listen on port 80 or custom ports.
- Communication runs on Layer 7 (Application Layer), HTTPS runs on Layer 6 (Presentation Layer).

**Common Mistakes:**
- Exposed passwords in source code  
- Sensitive info on public pages  
- Detailed internal server disclosures  
- Outdated CMS versions

> *Note:* Check cadaver.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- XSS (Cross Site Scripting)  
- SQL Injection  
- Code Injection  
- File Inclusion  
- Brute Force  
- File Upload vulnerabilities  

> *Note:* Many of these are eligible for bug bounty programs.

##### B. Network Exploitation

- Involves exploiting network-level services and protocols.
- Goal: Gain access to sensitive data.
- Requires identification of open ports and service versions.
- Automation possible using Metasploit.

---

#### 3.2.5 Post-Exploitation

- Objective: Maintain persistence on compromised systems.
- Persistence ensures continued access post-exploitation.

**Methods:**
- User Land Persistence  
- Kernel Land Persistence (Advanced - Out of Scope)  
- Boot-Level Persistence (Out of Scope)  

> *Note:* Kernel land persistence is hard to detect and often used by advanced attackers.

### Pivoting

- Technique used to move laterally across a compromised network to access additional resources or systems.

Command Breakdown: `ssh -D 8090 msfadmin@192.168.50.3`

This command sets up a **SOCKS proxy** using SSH, allowing your local applications (e.g., browser, curl, etc.) to tunnel their traffic through a remote host securely.

Explanation:

1. `ssh`
Starts a **secure shell session** with the target machine.

> Used for encrypted communication with remote servers.

---

2. `-D 8090`
Creates a **dynamic port forwarding tunnel** (SOCKS proxy) on **local port 8090**.

> This allows your local machine to redirect application traffic (like a browser or proxy-aware tool) through the SSH tunnel.

You can then set your application to use:
```
SOCKS5 Proxy: 127.0.0.1:8090
```

---

3. `msfadmin@192.168.50.3`
Connects to the **remote machine** at IP `192.168.50.3` using the **user `msfadmin`**.

> This machine becomes the exit point for all tunneled traffic.

---

‚ùì What is a SOCKS Proxy?

A **SOCKS proxy** (usually SOCKS5) is a **general-purpose, lower-level proxy** that can route all types of traffic, including:

- üåê Web (HTTP/HTTPS)
- üìÅ FTP
- üñ•Ô∏è SSH
- üß™ Custom protocols

Unlike traditional SSH port forwarding (`-L`), which redirects only a specific port to a specific target, **`-D` enables dynamic forwarding**: the remote host can send traffic to **any destination** you specify via your proxy-aware application.
